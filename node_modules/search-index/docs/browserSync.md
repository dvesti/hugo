# How to Sync from a Server to a Browser

This is a fairly broad topic with a lot of different use cases. One
big one would be making a Norch endpoint run offline, another would be
making an iOS app that merges in updates to a search index every so
often.

This page will be filled out eventually. In the meantime, the
[quickstart](quickstart.md) has a fairly bare bones demo of how to get
and sync data from a remote server.
