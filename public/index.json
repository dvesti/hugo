Often, content authors are forced to add raw HTML (e.g., video \u0026lt;iframes\u0026gt;) to Markdown content. We think this contradicts the beautiful simplicity of Markdown\u0026rsquo;s syntax.\nHugo created shortcodes to circumvent these limitations.\nA shortcode is a simple snippet inside a content file that Hugo will render using a predefined template. Note that shortcodes will not work in template files. If you need the type of drop-in functionality that shortcodes provide but in a template, you most likely want a [partial template][partials] instead.\nIn addition to cleaner Markdown, shortcodes can be updated any time to reflect new classes, techniques, or standards. At the point of site generation, Hugo shortcodes will easily merge in your changes. You avoid a possibly complicated search and replace operation.\nMore details: https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/\n","permalink":"https://dvesti.github.io/site-hugo/post/shortcodes-preview/","title":"Shortcodes Preview"},{"content":"Thanks for liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery \u0026amp; Zebradil · Pull Request #48 .\nNow, we could use {{\u0026lt; gallery \u0026gt;}} shortcode in hugo-theme-jane.\nNormal Image This is an image in static/image folder.\n1  ![This is an image in `static/image` folder.](/image/example.jpg)   ","permalink":"https://dvesti.github.io/site-hugo/post/image-preview/","title":"Image Preview"},{"content":"Hugo-theme-jane optimized for footnote.
